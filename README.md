# Castle Builder 

Java based command line app to build castles on valleys and peaks.

## Requirements

- JUnit4
- Java 1.8 Runtime

## Getting Started

javac -c Main.java

### Usage

Use - main <i>[csv integer array]

eg. main [1,5,2,4,6,8,1]

## Assumptions

- Castles are not built on the final space. If this is necessary, just add an additional castle to the total as a castle would always be built on the last space.
